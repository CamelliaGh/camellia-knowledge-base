# 🌟 Camellia's Knowledge Base

Welcome to my personal learning archive — a growing public repository of everything I’ve been learning and building in the areas of **AI**, **Prompt Engineering**, **Product Management**, and **Technical Skills**.

🌱 **Purpose:**  
To share helpful, structured notes and templates that others can learn from — and to demonstrate my ongoing development journey to future teams, collaborators, and interviewers.
